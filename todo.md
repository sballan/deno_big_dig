## How to use this file

Claude, this is for you. Work on the unfinished tasks in this document, one by
one, in order. Do not mark a task as complete until you've asked me first and
I've confirmed that the task is finished.

Once you've completed all the tasks in a second, ask me if I want to archive the
section. If I say yes, move the section into the archive below.

## Tasks

      rendering correctly. Can you examine the code and figure out what this is?
